**Dodgem **is a simple C++ game using OOP, where a player-controlled object avoids moving obstacles. The game comprises classes for Player and Obstacle, with methods to handle movement and collision detection. The Game class manages the overall game state, including initialization, updating, rendering, and handling the game over scenario. The main function creates a Game instance, initiates the game loop, and continuously updates and renders the game until collision occurs, displaying the player's score upon game over.
